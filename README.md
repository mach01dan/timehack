# Time Hacked

A tiny, client-side web app that helps visualize and manage small time hacks.

## Overview

Time Hacked is a lightweight static app that demonstrates a simple time-management / time-tracking UI. It's implemented with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so you can open it locally without any build tools.

## Features

- Simple, dependency-free UI for time hacks and short tasks
- Fast local usage — no server required
- Easy to read and extend JavaScript (`script.js`) and styles (`styles.css`)

## Files

- [index.html](index.html) — App entry page
- [script.js](script.js) — Main JavaScript logic
- [styles.css](styles.css) — Styling

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or serve with a static file server).

Quick local preview with Python 3 (optional):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Development

- Edit `script.js` to change app behavior.
- Edit `styles.css` to change appearance.
- No build step — just reload the page after edits.
